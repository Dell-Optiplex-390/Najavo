	<h2>Why Us?</h2>
	<p>Najavo Operating System also known and shortened to "NajavoOS" starts in 2018 when Najavo was a one man job, I used to make software and YouTube videos <b>which I still do today!</b>, luckily this had taught me 4 new programming languages: Lua, C# and HTML and a bit of C++. With this knowledge I spent 2 years making apps and websites, until late 2020 when I had gained a bit of knowledge with OS Developing, and started making my first very own OS using Cosmos, at first it got a little bit of getting used to then in the first 2 months I was ready to make my own OS</p>
